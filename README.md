# QQC
Quick-Query-from-Cache(JAVA)

 this is a simple idea about using localCache which is finished in two days(2019-01-28--01-29);
 there are two different self-defined structures(QQCStructureIndex & QQCStructureMap) about the cache which are base on map and list；
 QQCStructureMap(see QQCStructureMap.java) is juest a wrapper of HashMap;
 QQCStructureIndex(see QQCStructureIndex.java) is an implementor of the idea 'The Tndex Look-Up';
